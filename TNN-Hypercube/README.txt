Compile with:
	javac Hypercube.java

Run with:
	java Hypercube

The Program will calculate the values for L, alpha and E and show their values.
It will also show the minimal and maximal values for the generated data set.
Furthermore it will generate three files
	length.histogram
	angle.histogram
	distance.histogram

each containing the data to plot a histogram of the distributions. You can use the files
	length.gp
	angle.gp
	distance.gp

with GnuPlot to generate these histograms.
